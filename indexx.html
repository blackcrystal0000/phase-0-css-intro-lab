    </div>

        <p>
            As we write CSS these are the type of questions we might ask ourselves:
            <ul>
                <li>Should we layout the text in a single or double column?</li>
                <li>Should we use a different font color for the header?</li>
                <li>How should the very same content appear differently on a desktop vs. a mobile device?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>All of the questions above deal with esthetic and function considerations. These are the perspectives of the presentational layer(CSS)</p>

           Let's consider the type of questions we might ask ourselves as we write HTML:
            <ul>
                <li>Does the order of items within a list matter?Should it be a numbered list?</li>
                <li>Should we wrap a list of links inside a navigation tag?</li>
                <li>Is this the most important header in the whole HTML document?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>The last few questions deal with structure, hierarchy, and meaning. These are the perspectives of the content layer (HTML).</p>

    <p>When we write CSS we focus on esthetic and function considerations. When we write HTML we focus on structure, hierarchy, and meaning.</p>
